This version is mainly different from version 1 in the sense that 
the class functions are in a more understandable order,
and that the Water class now has a hitbox attached to it.
So that way the walkers can move without checking their surroundings if they're out of the hitbox.

I also unrolled the Walker.search() function because apparently it's faster than the loops that way
